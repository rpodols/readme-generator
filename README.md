# Professional README Generator - Challenge 9

## Description
This project is the ninth challenge of the coding bootcamp.

User Story: As a developer, I want a README generator, so that I can quickly create a professional README for new projects. 

Starting from minimal starter code, this challenge required writing additional code to do the following:
* when prompted for information about my application repository, then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
* when I enter my project title, then this is displayed as the title of the README
* when I enter a description, installation instructions, usage informaiton, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, then this information is added to the appropriate sections of the README
* when I choose a license for my application from a list of options, then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section entitled license
* when I enter my GitHub username, then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
* when I enter my email address, then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions how to be reached with additional questions
* when I click on the links in the Table of Contents, then I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

## Table of Contents
- [Description](#description)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [License](#license)
- [Tests](#tests)
- [Questions](#questions)

## Made Using:
* Node.js

## Installation
* to install, clone the repository from GitHub, run the command 'npm i' while in the project directory, and then run 'node index' to launch the README generator within the terminal/command line

## Usage
* this can be used as an automated way to generate README files, rather than having to create them manually for each application

## Contributing
* no outside contributions at this time

## License
* MIT License

## Tests
* tests can be run by entering any sort of data to the question prompts, and confirming that data pulls through on the README.md generated in the applications 'dist' folder

## Questions
* any questions, please feel free to reach out via email to rdpodols@gmail.com
