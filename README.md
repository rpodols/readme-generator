# Professional README Generator - Challenge 9

This project is the ninth challenge of the coding bootcamp.

User Story: As a developer, I want a README generator, so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project. 

Starting from minimal starter code, this challenge required writing additional code to do the following:
* when prompted for information about my application repository, then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
* when I enter my project title, then this is displayed as the title of the README
* when I enter a description, installation instructions, usage informaiton, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, then this information is added to the appropriate sections of the README
* when I choose a license for my applicaiton from a list of options, then a badge for that license is added near the top of the REAME and a notice is added to the section entitled license
* when I enter my GitHub username, then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
* when I enter my email address, then this is added to the section fo the README entitle Questions, with instructions how to be reached with additional questions
* when I click on the links in the Table of Contents, then I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

## Made Using:
* Node.js
